                        The Minnesota State Park system has existed since the establishment of Itasca State Park in 1891.
                        Since then, the system has grown to 72 state park and recreation areas.
                        Many of these sites have utility infrastructure to support the staff and visitors including electric, water, wastewater, stormwater, fuel, and telecommunications systems.
                        Knowing where these systems are located and their conditions is extremely valuable for unit staff in prioritizing repair and upgrades to aging infrastructure, minimizing risk and impacts, and making decisions for natural, cultural, and recreation projects.
                        Currently, the infrastructure details are on paper maps and in the memories of staff.
                        In 2021 the DNR started a project to inventory above and below ground utilities at units managed by the Division of Parks and Trails.
                        This presentation describes the tools and techniques and success and challenges the team faced as they conducted the project over the last two years.

                    <p>River terraces, the remnants of ancient river floodplain surfaces, provide a glimpse into the evolution of a river through time. The terraces of the Zumbro River, a tributary of the Mississippi River in southeastern Minnesota, were chosen for study due to the river’s complex history involving glacial retreat and the drop in the elevation of the Mississippi River. I manually digitized river terraces using a 5-meter resolution Digital Elevation Model and plotted their elevations against the distance along the centerline of the river valley. The results indicate one high-elevation terrace level indicative of the floodplain surface at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum, as well as lower terraces indicating a response in the Zumbro river system to a drop in base level of the Mississippi River. These findings provide us with a more complete understanding of the history of the Zumbro River system, and will help construct a reference against which we can compare computer models of fluvial evolution.River terraces, the remnants of ancient river floodplain surfaces, provide a glimpse into the evolution of a river through time.
