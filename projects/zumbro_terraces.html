                    <h1>Mapping Terraces of the Zumbro River</h1>
                    <p>
                        The Zumbro River, or Wazi Oju, is a tributary of the Upper Mississippi River located in southeastern Minnesota.
                        In summer 2020, I joined the <a href="https://mnimorph.science/">MNiMORPH Research Group</a> at the University of Minnesota and began mapping the river's terraces.

                    <h2>What are River Terraces?</h2>
                    <p>
                        When rivers flood and overtop their banks, they deposit sediment in the surrounding area called the floodplain.
                        After a river incises into its bed, remnants of the floodplain it left behind remain above the new floodplain.
                        These remnants are known as <b>terraces</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Upper Mississippi and its tributaries have multiple levels of terraces corresponding to episodes of incision and aggradation as they responded to the retreat of glaciers following the Last Glacial Maximum.
