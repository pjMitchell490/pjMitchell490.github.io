                    <h1>Mapping Terraces of the Zumbro River</h1>
                    <p>
                        The Zumbro River, or Wazi Oju, is a tributary of the Upper Mississippi River located in southeastern Minnesota.
                        In summer 2020, I joined the <a href="https://mnimorph.science/">MNiMORPH Research Group</a> at the University of Minnesota and began mapping the river's terraces.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The River Long Profile</h2>
                    <p>
                        A channel's long profile is a representation of its changing elevation as you move from its upstream to its downstream end.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What are River Terraces?</h2>
                    <p>
                        When rivers flood and overtop their banks, they deposit sediment in the surrounding area called the floodplain.
                        After a river incises into its bed, remnants of the floodplain it left behind remain above the new floodplain.
                        These remnants are known as <b>terraces</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Upper Mississippi and its tributaries have multiple levels of terraces corresponding to episodes of incision and aggradation as they responded to the retreat of glaciers following the Last Glacial Maximum.
                        By identifying these terraces and comparing their positions to the modern floodplain, we can piece together the history of the river's evolution.

                    <p><i>Note: For performance reasons, the features shown are simplified representations of those used for my research.
                        Original polygons were hand-digitized using a 5m DEM. Terrace, floodplain, and valley centerline shapefiles can be found on <a href="https://github.com/pjMitchell490/Zumbro_Shapefiles">my Github</a>.
                    </i></p>
                    <p>
                        In lieu of a traditional legend (which will be added at a later date), filled polygons represent terraces, semi-transparent polygons represent the modern floodplain, and the solid lines represent the centerline of the river valley.
