                        <p>
                            These projects were inspired by <a href="https://dancoecarto.com/">Daniel Coe</a>, Graphics Editor for the Washington State Geological Survey.
                            When I was a college freshman, unsure of what path I wanted to take, his work contributed to my budding interest in the geosciences.

                            Relative Elevation Models (REMs) are products derived from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), which are raster grids where each cell contains a value representing its elevation above a constant baseline, typically sea level.
                            Relative Elevation Models transform these grids such that each cell's value represents its elevation above the river surface.
                            The resulting raster emphasizes geomorphic features of the river system, including past meanders and oxbow lakes.
                            With relatively little experimentation with the raster's symbology, you can create beautiful art.

                                It's this website's background and, in my opinion, for good reason.
                                I love the flowing nature of the image and it's a good reminder of my time living in the watershed as a Conservation Corps member at the Fillmore Soil and Water Conservation District.

                            Before trying to create Relative Elevation Models, I tried similar work with DEMs.
                            As you can see in the picture below, you can still get pretty images, but with the baseline elevation at a constant value, the resulting colors are affected by a point's distance upstream.

                            <p>
                                One observation of note is that using the DEM rather than the REM highlights the Lanesboro Dam, as the significant change in elevation results in a sudden shift from a more muted purple upstream to deeper hues downstream.
